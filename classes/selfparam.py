# The self Parameter

# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.
# It is used to access properties and methods that belong to the class.

# Use self to access class properties:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def greet(self):
    print("Hello, my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("Emil", 25)
p1.greet()

# Note: The self parameter must be the first parameter of any method in the class.

# Why Use self?

# Without self, Python would not know which object's properties you want to access:
# The self parameter links the method to the specific object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def printname(self):
    print(self.name)

p1 = Person("Tobias")
p2 = Person("Linus")

p1.printname()
p2.printname()

# self Does Not Have to Be Named "self"

# It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any method in the class:
# Use the words myobject and abc instead of self:
class Person:
  def __init__(myobject, name, age):
    myobject.name = name
    myobject.age = age

  def greet(abc):
    print("Hello, my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)
p1.greet()

# Note: While you can use a different name, it is strongly recommended to use self as it is the convention in Python and makes your code more readable to others.

# Accessing Properties with self

# You can access any property of the class using self:
# Access multiple properties using self:
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model
    self.year = year

  def display_info(self):
    print(f"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}")

car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car1.display_info()

# Calling Methods with self

# You can also call other methods within the class using self:
# Call one method from another method using self:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def greet(self):
    return "Hello, " + self.name

  def welcome(self):
    message = self.greet()
    print(message + "! Welcome to our website.")

p1 = Person("Tobias")
p1.welcome()
