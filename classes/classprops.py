# Class Properties

# Properties are variables that belong to a class. They store data for each object created from the class.
# Create a class with properties:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

# Access Properties

# You can access object properties using dot notation:
# Access the properties of an object:
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

print(car1.brand)
print(car1.model)

# Modify Properties

# You can modify the value of properties on objects:
# Change the age property:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Tobias", 25)
print(p1.age)

p1.age = 26
print(p1.age)

# Delete Properties

# You can delete properties from objects using the del keyword:
# Delete the age property:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Linus", 30)

del p1.age

print(p1.name) # This works
# print(p1.age) # This would cause an error

# Class Properties vs Object Properties

# Properties defined inside __init__() belong to each object (instance properties).
# Properties defined outside methods belong to the class itself (class properties) and are shared by all objects:
# Class property vs instance property:
class Person:
  species = "Human" # Class property

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name # Instance property

p1 = Person("Emil")
p2 = Person("Tobias")

print(p1.name)
print(p2.name)
print(p1.species)
print(p2.species)

# Modifying Class Properties

# When you modify a class property, it affects all objects:
# Change a class property:
class Person:
  lastname = ""

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

p1 = Person("Linus")
p2 = Person("Emil")

Person.lastname = "Refsnes"

print(p1.lastname)
print(p2.lastname)

# Add New Properties

# You can add new properties to existing objects:
# Add a new property to an object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

p1 = Person("Tobias")

p1.age = 25
p1.city = "Oslo"

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
print(p1.city)

# Note: Adding properties this way only adds them to that specific object, not to all objects of the class.
