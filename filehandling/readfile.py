# Open a File

# Assume we have the following file, located in the same folder as Python:

# demofile.txt

# To open the file, use the built-in open() function.
# The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.read())

# If the file is located in a different location, you will have to specify the file path, like this:
f = open("/home/steve/projects/python_basics/filehandling/demofile.txt")
print(f.read())

# Using the with statement

# You can also use the with statement when opening a file:
# Using the with keyword:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

# Then you do not have to worry about closing your files, the with statement takes care of that.

# Close Files

# It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
# If you are not using the with statement, you must write a close statement in order to close the file:
# Close the file when you are finished with it:
f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.readline())
f.close()

# Note: You should always close your files. In some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.

# Read Only Parts of the File

# By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:
# Return the 5 first characters of the file:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read(5))

# Read Lines

# You can return one line by using the readline() method:
# Read one line of the file:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline())

# By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:
# Read two lines of the file:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline())
  print(f.readline())

# By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:
# Loop through the file line by line:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  for x in f:
    print(x)
