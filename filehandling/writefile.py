# Python File Write

# Write to an Existing File

# To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:
# "a" - Append - will append to the end of the file
# "w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

# Open the file "demofile.txt" and append content to the file:
with open("demofile.txt", "a") as f:
  f.write("Now the file has more content!")

#open and read the file after the appending:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

# Overwrite Existing Content

# To overwrite the existing content to the file, use the w parameter:
# Open the file "demofile.txt" and overwrite the content:
with open("demofile.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")

#open and read the file after the overwriting:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

# Note: the "w" method will overwrite the entire file.

# Create a New File

# To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:
# "x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists
# "a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exists
# "w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

# Create a new file called "myfile.txt":
f = open("myfile.txt", "x")

# Result: a new empty file is created.

# Note: If the file already exists, an error will be raised.
