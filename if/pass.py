# The pass Statement

# if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass

# The pass statement is a null operation - nothing happens when it executes. It serves as a placeholder.

# Why Use pass?

# The pass statement is useful in several situations:

#    When you're creating code structure but haven't implemented the logic yet
#    When a statement is required syntactically but no action is needed
#    As a placeholder for future code during development
#    In empty functions or classes that you plan to implement later

# pass in Development

# During development, you might want to sketch out your program structure before implementing the details. The pass statement allows you to do this without syntax errors.
# Placeholder for future implementation:
age = 16

if age < 18:
  pass # TODO: Add underage logic later
else:
  print("Access granted")

# pass vs Comments

# A comment is ignored by Python, but pass is an actual statement that gets executed (though it does nothing). You need pass where Python expects a statement, not just a comment.
# This will cause an error (empty code block):
# score = 85

# if score > 90:
  # This is excellent
# This will raise an IndentationError

# This works correctly with pass:
score = 85

if score > 90:
  pass # This is excellent
print("Score processed")

# pass with Multiple Conditions

# You can use pass in any branch of an if-elif-else statement.
# Using pass in different branches:
value = 50

if value < 0:
  print("Negative value")
elif value == 0:
  pass # Zero case - no action needed
else:
  print("Positive value")

# pass in Other Contexts

# While we focus on pass with if statements here, it's also commonly used with loops, functions, and classes.
# Using pass with functions:
def calculate_discount(price):
  pass # TODO: Implement discount logic

# Function exists but doesn't do anything yet
