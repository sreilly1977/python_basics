# Short Hand If

# If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
# One-line if statement:
a = 5
b = 2
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

# Note: You still need the colon : after the condition.

# Short Hand If ... Else

# If you have one statement for if and one for else, you can put them on the same line using a conditional expression:
# One-line if/else that prints a value:
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

# This is called a conditional expression (sometimes known as a "ternary operator").

# Assign a Value With If ... Else

# You can also use a one-line if/else to choose a value and assign it to a variable:
a = 10
b = 20
bigger = a if a > b else b
print("Bigger is", bigger)

# The syntax follows this pattern:
# variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

# Multiple Conditions on One Line

# You can chain conditional expressions, but keep it short so it stays readable:
# One line, three outcomes:
a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

# Practical Examples

# Ternary operators are particularly useful for simple assignments and return statements.
# Finding the maximum of two numbers:
x = 15
y = 20
max_value = x if x > y else y
print("Maximum value:", max_value)

# Setting a default value:
username = ""
display_name = username if username else "Guest"
print("Welcome,", display_name)

# When to Use Shorthand If

# Shorthand if statements and ternary operators should be used when:

#     The condition and actions are simple
#     It improves code readability
 #    You want to make a quick assignment based on a condition

# Important: While shorthand if statements can make code more concise, avoid overusing them for complex conditions.
# For readability, use regular if-else statements when dealing with multiple lines of code or complex logic.
