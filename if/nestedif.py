# Nested If Statements

# You can have if statements inside if statements. This is called nested if statements.
x = 41

if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")

# In this example, the inner if statement only runs if the outer condition (x > 10) is true.

# How Nested If Works

# Each level of nesting creates a deeper level of decision-making. The code evaluates from the outermost condition inward.
# Checking multiple conditions with nesting:
age = 25
has_license = True

if age >= 18:
  if has_license:
    print("You can drive")
  else:
    print("You need a license")
else:
  print("You are too young to drive")

# Multiple Levels of Nesting

# You can nest as many levels deep as needed, but keep in mind that too many levels can make code harder to read.
# Three levels of nesting:
score = 85
attendance = 90
submitted = True

if score >= 60:
  if attendance >= 80:
    if submitted:
      print("Pass with good standing")
    else:
      print("Pass but missing assignment")
  else:
    print("Pass but low attendance")
else:
  print("Fail")

# Nested If vs Logical Operators

# Sometimes nested if statements can be simplified using logical operators like and. The choice depends on your logic.
# This nested if:
temperature = 25
is_sunny = True

if temperature > 20:
  if is_sunny:
    print("Perfect beach weather!")

# Could also be written with and:
temperature = 25
is_sunny = True

if temperature > 20 and is_sunny:
  print("Perfect beach weather!")

# Both approaches produce the same result. Use nested if statements when the inner logic is complex or depends on the outer condition.
# Use and when both conditions are simple and equally important.

# More Examples

# Login validation with nested checks:
username = "Emil"
password = "python123"
is_active = True

if username:
  if password:
    if is_active:
      print("Login successful")
    else:
      print("Account is not active")
  else:
    print("Password required")
else:
  print("Username required")

# Grade calculation with nested logic:
score = 92
extra_credit = 5

if score >= 90:
  if extra_credit > 0:
    print("A+ grade")
  else:
    print("A grade")
elif score >= 80:
  print("B grade")
else:
  print("C grade or below")
