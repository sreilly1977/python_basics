# Recursion

# Recursion is when a function calls itself.
# Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself.
# This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.
# The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates,
# or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a
# very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

# A simple recursive function that counts down from 5:
def countdown(n):
  if n <= 0:
    print("Done!")
  else:
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)

countdown(5)

# Base Case and Recursive Case

# Every recursive function must have two parts:

#    A base case - A condition that stops the recursion
#    A recursive case - The function calling itself with a modified argument

# Without a base case, the function would call itself forever, causing a stack overflow error.

# Identifying base case and recursive case:
def factorial(n):
  # Base case
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  # Recursive case
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))

# The base case is crucial. Always make sure your recursive function has a condition that will eventually be met.

# Fibonacci Sequence

# The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

# The sequence continues indefinitely, with each number being the sum of the two preceding ones.
# We can use recursion to find a specific number in the sequence:
# Find the 7th number in the Fibonacci sequence:
def fibonacci(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return n
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(7))

# Recursion with Lists

# Recursion can be used to process lists by handling one element at a time:
# Calculate the sum of all elements in a list:
def sum_list(numbers):
  if len(numbers) == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return numbers[0] + sum_list(numbers[1:])

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_list(my_list))

# Find the maximum value in a list:
def find_max(numbers):
  if len(numbers) == 1:
    return numbers[0]
  else:
    max_of_rest = find_max(numbers[1:])
    return numbers[0] if numbers[0] > max_of_rest else max_of_rest

my_list = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]
print(find_max(my_list))

# Recursion Depth Limit

# Python has a limit on how deep recursion can go. The default limit is usually around 1000 recursive calls.
# Check the recursion limit:
import sys
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())

# If you need deeper recursion, you can increase the limit, but be careful as this can cause crashes:
# import sys
# sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)
# print(sys.getrecursionlimit())

# Increasing the recursion limit should be done with caution. For very deep recursion, consider using iteration instead.
