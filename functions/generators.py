# Generators

# Generators are functions that can pause and resume their execution.
# When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.
# The code inside the function is not executed yet, it is only compiled. The function only executes when you iterate over the generator.
# A simple generator function:
def my_generator():
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3

for value in my_generator():
  print(value)

# Generators allow you to iterate over data without storing the entire dataset in memory.

# Instead of using return, generators use the yield keyword.

# The yield Keyword

# The yield keyword is what makes a function a generator.
# When yield is encountered, the function's state is saved, and the value is returned. The next time the generator is called, it continues from where it left off.
# Generator that yields numbers:
def count_up_to(n):
  count = 1
  while count <= n:
    yield count
    count += 1

for num in count_up_to(5):
  print(num)

# Unlike return, which terminates the function, yield pauses it and can be called multiple times.

# Generators Saves Memory

# Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly instead of storing everything in memory.
# For large datasets, generators save memory:
# Generator for large sequences:
def large_sequence(n):
  for i in range(n):
    yield i

# This doesn't create a million numbers in memory
gen = large_sequence(1000000)
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))

# Using next() with Generators

# You can manually iterate through a generator using the next() function:
def simple_gen():
  yield "Emil"
  yield "Tobias"
  yield "Linus"

gen = simple_gen()
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))

# When there are no more values to yield, the generator raises a StopIteration exception:
def simple_gen():
  yield 1
  yield 2

gen = simple_gen()
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
# print(next(gen)) # This will raise StopIteration

# Generator Expressions

# Similar to list comprehensions, you can create generators using generator expressions with parentheses instead of square brackets:
# List comprehension vs generator expression:
# List comprehension - creates a list
list_comp = [x * x for x in range(5)]
print(list_comp)

# Generator expression - creates a generator
gen_exp = (x * x for x in range(5))
print(gen_exp)
print(list(gen_exp))

# Using a generator expression with sum:
# Calculate sum of squares without creating a list
total = sum(x * x for x in range(10))
print(total)

# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

# Generators can be used to create the Fibonacci sequence.
# It can continue generating values indefinitely, without running out of memory:
# Generate 100 Fibonacci numbers:
def fibonacci():
  a, b = 0, 1
  while True:
    yield a
    a, b = b, a + b

# Get first 100 Fibonacci numbers
gen = fibonacci()
for _ in range(100):
  print(next(gen))

# Generator Methods

# Generators have special methods for advanced control:

# send() Method

# The send() method allows you to send a value to the generator:
def echo_generator():
  while True:
    received = yield
    print("Received:", received)

gen = echo_generator()
next(gen) # Prime the generator
gen.send("Hello")
gen.send("World")

# close() Method

# The close() method stops the generator:
def my_gen():
  try:
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
  finally:
    print("Generator closed")

gen = my_gen()
print(next(gen))
gen.close()
