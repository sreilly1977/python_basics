# dentity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

# Operator 	Description 	Example

# is  	Returns True if both variables are the same object 	x is y

# is not 	Returns True if both variables are not the same object 	x is not y

# The is operator returns True if both variables point to the same object:
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is z)
print(x is y)
print(x == y)

# The is not operator returns True if both variables do not point to the same object:
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]

print(x is not y)

# Difference Between is and ==

#    is - Checks if both variables point to the same object in memory
#    == - Checks if the values of both variables are equal
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

print(x == y)
print(x is y)
