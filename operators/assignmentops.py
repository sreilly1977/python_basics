# Assignment Operators

# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

# Operator 	Example 	Same As

# = 	x = 5 	x = 5

# += 	x += 3 	x = x + 3

# -= 	x -= 3 	x = x - 3

# *= 	x *= 3 	x = x * 3

# /= 	x /= 3 	x = x / 3

# %= 	x %= 3 	x = x % 3

# //= 	x //= 3 	x = x // 3

# **= 	x **= 3 	x = x ** 3

# &= 	x &= 3 	x = x & 3

# |= 	x |= 3 	x = x | 3

# ^= 	x ^= 3 	x = x ^ 3

# >>= 	x >>= 3 	x = x >> 3

# <<= 	x <<= 3 	x = x << 3

# := 	print(x := 3) 	x = 3
#                       print(x)

# The Walrus Operator

# Python 3.8 introduced the := operator, known as the "walrus operator". It assigns values to variables
# as part of a larger expression:

# The count variable is assigned in the if statement, and given the value 5:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if (count := len(numbers)) > 3:
    print(f"List has {count} elements")
