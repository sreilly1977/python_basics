# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefore multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)

# The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

# Operator 	Description

# () 	Parentheses

# ** 	Exponentiation

# +x  -x  ~x 	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT

# *  /  //  % 	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus

# +  - 	Addition and subtraction

# <<  >> 	Bitwise left and right shifts

# & 	Bitwise AND

# ^ 	Bitwise XOR

# | 	Bitwise OR

# ==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in  	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators

# not 	Logical NOT

# and 	AND

# or 	OR


# If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.
# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefore we evaluate the expression from left to right:
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
