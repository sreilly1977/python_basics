# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

# Operator 	Description 	Example

# in  	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object 	x in y

# not in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object 	x not in y

# heck if "banana" is present in a list:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("banana" in fruits)

# Check if "pineapple" is NOT present in a list:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("pineapple" not in fruits)

# The membership operators also work with strings:
text = "Hello World"

print("H" in text)
print("hello" in text)
print("z" not in text)
