# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

# Operator 	Name 	Description 	Example

# &  	AND 	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 	x & y

# | 	OR 	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 	x | y

# ^ 	XOR 	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 	x ^ y

# ~ 	NOT 	Inverts all the bits 	~x

# << 	Zero fill left shift 	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off 	x << 2

# >> 	Signed right shift 	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off 	x >> 2

# The & operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if both are 1, otherwise it is set to 0:
print(6 & 3)

# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011
# Then the & operator compares the bits and returns 0010, which is 2 in decimal.

#The | operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if one or both is 1, otherwise it is set to 0:
print(6 | 3)

# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011
# Then the | operator compares the bits and returns 0111, which is 7 in decimal.

# The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:
print(6 ^ 3)

# The binary representation of 6 is 0110
# The binary representation of 3 is 0011
# Then the ^ operator compares the bits and returns 0101, which is 5 in decimal.
