# frozenset is an immutable version of a set.

# Like sets, it contains unique, unordered, unchangeable elements.
# Unlike sets, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.

# Creating a frozenset

# Use the frozenset() constructor to create a frozenset from any iterable.
# Create a frozenset and check its type:
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
print(x)
print(type(x))

# Frozenset Methods

# Being immutable means you cannot add or remove elements. However, frozensets support all non-mutating operations of sets.

# Method 	Shortcut 	Description
# copy() 	  	Returns a shallow copy
# difference() 	- 	Returns a new frozenset with the difference
# intersection() 	& 	Returns a new frozenset with the intersection
# isdisjoint() 	  	Returns whether two frozensets have an intersection
# issubset() 	<= / < 	Returns True if this frozenset is a (proper) subset of another
# issuperset() 	>= / > 	Returns True if this frozenset is a (proper) superset of another
# symmetric_difference() 	^ 	Returns a new frozenset with the symmetric differences
# union() 	| 	Returns a new frozenset containing the union
