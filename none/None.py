# Python None

# None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value.
# Its data type is NoneType, and None is the only instance of a NoneType object.

# NoneType

# Variables can be assigned None to indicate "no value" or "not set".
# Assign and display a None value:
x = None
print(x)

# Use type() to see the type of a None value.
# Assign and print the data type of a None value:
x = None
print(type(x))

# Comparing to None

# To compare a value to None, use the identity operator is or is not
# Use the identity operator is for comparisons with None:
result = None
if result is None:
  print("No result yet")
else:
  print("Result is ready")

# Similar example, but using is not instead:
result = None
if result is not None:
  print("Result is ready")
else:
  print("No result yet")

# True or False

# None evaluates to False in a boolean context.
# Check truthiness:
print(bool(None))

# Functions returning None

# Functions that do not explicitly return a value return None by default.
# A function without a return statement returns None:
def myfunc():
  x = 5

x = myfunc()
print(x)
