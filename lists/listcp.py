# Copy a List

# You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1,
# and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

# Use the copy() method

# You can use the built-in List method copy() to copy a list.
# Make a copy of a list with the copy() method:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)

# Use the list() method

# Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().
# Make a copy of a list with the list() method:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)

# Use the slice Operator

# You can also make a copy of a list by using the : (slice) operator.
# Make a copy of a list with the : operator:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist[:]
print(mylist)
